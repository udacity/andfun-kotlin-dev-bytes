 * DevByteViewModel designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. This
 * allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations. In addition, background
 * work such as fetching network results can continue through configuration changes and deliver
 * results after the new Fragment or Activity is available.
 *
 * @param application The application that this viewmodel is attached to, it's safe to hold a
 * reference to applications across rotation since Application is never recreated during actiivty
 * or fragment lifecycle events.
